👋 Welcome, it's great to have you here.

We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site
with some initial getting started  posts that will help you get familiar with
everything in no time. This is the first one!

A few things you should know upfront:

 1. Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to
    actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best
    for. 
 2. The entire platform can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's
    very powerful, but does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not
    necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple
    personal blog. 
 3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App
    [https://ghost.org/downloads/]  for your computer, which is the best way to
    access your Ghost site on a desktop device. 

Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost
Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro)
[https://ghost.org/pricing]  service, and every penny we make is re-invested
into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern
publishing.

The version of Ghost you are looking at right now would not have been made
possible without generous contributions from the open source community
[https://github.com/TryGhost].

Next up, the editor
The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor
[/the-editor/]. This is where the good stuff happens.

By the way, once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default Ghost 
user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
