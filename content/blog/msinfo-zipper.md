MSINFO Zipper-
I have created this tool to help forum members who help other people regarding
computer problems. The geek people must be well versed with the vast amount of
information displayed by the MSINFO32.exe which is included in every Windows
Operating System. This tool has been created with one goal in mind and that is
one click run and making the process of generating the report and then zipping
it up. The tool generates the ZIP file at the Desktop. This tool just needs to
be run once to generate the ZIP File. No further interaction is required from
the user making the process a lot easier and reducing the chance of error to
almost 0.

If you want the user’s MSINFO32 report and don’t want him typing commands in the
DOS console and then ZIP up the file use this tool.

In case of any problem, please do contact me!
