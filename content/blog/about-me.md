Hello People & Welcome to OMG Debugging. I am Pranav and I am a Microsoft
Certified Professional & a Student ^_^. I am also the Microsoft Student Partner
in the university where I study. I write about different types of the problems
which I face and solve during my day to day work with computers. I like
analyzing Blue Screens Of Death & Dump Files and helping people suffering them.
I love playing DOTA & in case you would like me to write an article, please use
