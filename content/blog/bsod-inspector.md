BSOD Inspector
[http://omgdebugging.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BSODInspector.exe]
After a long time, the BSOD Inspector is finally out of BETA. I have tried my
best to get the information quickly which is needed to debug Blue Screen Of
Death problems.

I would like to thank specially to [John Carrona (Microsoft MVP)](
https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/John D. Carrona-33494) for helping me while
developing this.
Thanks a lot for your support and guidance ^_^.

Note 1:
In case you get a warning that the tool is malicious, please note that it is a
false positive.

Note 2:
The app will open a text window after it finishes, that will contain the name
and location of the file (by default, on your Desktop). Please upload that with
your next post.

Right now, this tool also embeds a message which is like a “fact”. In the coming
future, I am planning on doing this with other tools as well so that the users
get to know something.

Feel free to use it ^_^
