So, I have decided that I would be posting the BSOD problems being fixed by me
over various forums. These posts would include the issues being experienced by
the system owner and then followed by the fix suggested by me or what actually
worked for the system owner. This would not only help me maintain a record of
the possible fixes but also help other people having similar problems.

What the Problems Were :

 * Blue Screen Of Death after almost every hibernate/shutdown.

System – Asus Zenbook UX 32

What fixed the problem for the Owner –

 * Intel Rapid Storage needed to be removed
